Events
------

Events are high level representation of a transaction on the network.
Events must have the following attributes to be considered an event

- A timestamp
- Source/Destination IP
- Source/Destination Port

----------
The Event
----------
The Event class can represent almost any kind of transaction stored within DynamiteNSM.

As a matter of fact all network based events can be derived from this class.

Connection Event
-----------------

The Connection Event class is used to normalize two kinds of event sources.

- The first are events derived from the Zeek **conn.log**.
- The second are events derived from NetFlow devices.

Protocol Events
-----------------

The Dynamite SDK also supports a handful of protocol based events. These are derived from Zeek protocol logs.

Additional log support is being added everyday!
